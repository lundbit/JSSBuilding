<!-- Good Java Code Practice -->
<!--

  Rule One:  capitalization matters

  Rule Two: Use camelCase  variables (lower)  objects & classes (upper)
  constants (ALLCAPS)

  Rule Three:  Whitespace matters to us, not the browser, so have proper
  indentation.

  Rule Four: End each statement with a semicolon (even though it might not matter)

  Rule Five:  Use Lots of Comments    Single line //blah  /* multiblah  */
